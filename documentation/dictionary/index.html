There are
different types of connectors; connectors may also point to the right
or to the left. A left-pointing connector connects with a
right-pointing connector of the same type on another word. The two
connectors together form a <em>link</em>. A valid sentence is one in which
all the words present are used in a way which is valid according to
their rules (and which also satisfies certain global rules).</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>There is a description of the logic of link grammars, the notation of
the dictionary, and the features of version 4.0 of the parser in the
<a href="introduction.html">introduction</a>.</p><h3>English Guide-to-Links</h3><p>A AA AF AJ AL AM AN AZ B BI BT BW C CC CO CP CQ CV CX D DD DG DP DT E

YP YS Z ZZZ</p><p>This is an index to all link-types in the English dictionary. It
explains the grammatical usages of each link, and the way links are
combined to form complex constructions. It also explains all the uses
of post-processing: the kinds of links that start domains, the kinds
of domains they start, and the various kinds of post-processing
rules. The Guide-To-Links is designed for people who wish to
understand the syntactic aspect of the parser, or wish to edit the
dictionary or write their own dictionaries and already read the
<a href="introduction.html">introduction</a>.</p><p>Only actual link-types are listed alphabetically, but <strong>not
subscripts</strong>. However, each link subscript is explained in the entry
for the link-type. That is, each subscript character is explained. To
understand the usage of a link-type with more than one subscript, look
up the subscript-types separately. For example, for <code>SIsj</code>, look up
<code>SIs</code>, then <code>SI*j</code>. (The <code>*</code> character is the wild-card character used
in post-processing; in this context it is also a wild-card, meaning
&quot;the subscript in this position is not important for the moment&quot;.)</p><ul><li>A connects pre-noun (&quot;attributive&quot;) adjectives to following nouns:
