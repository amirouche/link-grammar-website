## Documentation

One of the best ways to obtain a solid, easy-to-understand overview of
the parser is to review the original papers describing it, here, here,
here and here. There is an extensive set of pages documenting the
dictionary; specifically, the names of links and their meanings, as
well as how to write new rules. There is also a short primer for
creating dictionaries for new languages. The documentation for the
programming API is here. Documentation for additions made in the 4.0
release is on the improvements page. A fairly comprehensive
bibliography of papers written before 2004 is here (mirror).
