## Documentation

One of the best ways to obtain a solid, easy-to-understand overview of
the parser is to review the original papers describing it:

- [Parsing English with a Link Grammar (1991)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/link/pub/www/papers/ps/tr91-196.pdf)
- [Parsing English with a Link Grammar (1993)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/link/pub/www/papers/ps/LG-IWPT93.pdf)
- [A Robust Parsing Algorithm for Link Grammars](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/link/pub/www/papers/ps/tr95-125.pdf)
- [Grammatical Trigrams: A Probabilistic Model of Link Grammar](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/link/pub/www/papers/ps/gram3gram.pdf)

There is an extensive set of pages
[documenting the dictionary](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/dict/index.html);
specifically, the names of links and their meanings, as well as how to
write new rules. There is also a
[short primer for creating dictionaries for new languages](http://ling.osu.edu/~jonsafari/link-grammar/primer.html). There
is also a
[documentation for the programming API](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/api/index.html). Documentation
for additions made in the 4.0 release is on the
[improvements page](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/dict/improvements.html). A
fairly comprehensive bibliography of
[papers written before 2004](http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/papers/index.html)
([mirror](http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/papers/index.html)).
